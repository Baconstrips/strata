# Agent Instructions

## Test organization

- Do not place test implementations inline with production code.
- Put module unit tests in an adjacent test module, such as `src/app/navigation/tests.rs`, and declare it from the implementation with `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`.
- Use the top-level `tests/` directory for integration tests that exercise the crate through its public API.
